<em>We consider fixed effects binary choice models with a fixed number of periods $T$ and without a large support condition on the regressors. If the time-varying unobserved terms are i.i.d. with known distribution $F$, Chamberlain (2010) shows that the common slope parameter is point identified if and only if $F$ is logistic. However, he only considers in his proof $T=2$. We show that actually, the result does not generalize to $T\geq 3$: the common slope parameter can be identified when $F$ belongs to a family including the logit distribution. Identification is based on a conditional moment restriction. Under restrictions on the covariates, these moment conditions lead to point identification of relative effects. Finally, if $T=3$ and mild conditions hold, GMM estimators based on these conditional moment restrictions reach the semiparametric efficiency bound.

 <li>Make the Difference! Computationally Trivial Estimators for Grouped Fixed Effects Models
<details><summary>[Abstract] [<a href="https://github.com/martinmugnier/martinmugnier.github.io/blob/50ba66bd61e4e1cc093bc1efe3c462d8cd23438f/files/pwd_estimators.pdf">Paper</a>][<a href="https://github.com/martinmugnier/PWD-Estimators">Replication Code</a>]</summary>
<p>
<em>Novel estimators are proposed for linear grouped fixed effects models. Rather than predicting a single grouping of units, they deliver a collection of groupings with the same flavor as the so-called LASSO regularization path. Mild conditions are found that ensure their asymptotic guarantees are the same as the so-called grouped fixed effects and post-spectral estimators (Bonhomme and Manresa, 2015; Chetverikov and Manresa, 2021). In contrast, the new estimators are computationally straigthforward and do not require prior knowledge of the number of groups. Monte Carlo simulations suggest good finite sample performance. Applying the approach to real data provides new insights on the potential network structure of the unobserved heterogeneity.
