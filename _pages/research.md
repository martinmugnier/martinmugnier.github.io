## Work in progress

#### Point Identification of Panel Binary Models Without Logit Errors (joint work with [Xavier D'HaultfÅ“euille](https://faculty.crest.fr/xdhaultfoeuille/) and [Laurent Davezies](http://www.crest.fr/ses.php?user=2986))
*We study point identification of fixed effects binary choice models with a fixed number of periods T and without a large support condition on the regressors. In such a setting, few positive results are available, even if the distribution of the i.i.d. shocks is supposed to be known. In fact, Chamberlain (2010) shows that the common slope parameter is point-identified if and only if the shocks are logistic. However, he only considers in his proof T = 2. We show that actually, the result does not generalize to T >= 3: the common slope parameter and some parameters of the distribution of the shocks can be identified when this distribution belongs to a family including the logit distribution. Identification is based on moments restrictions and we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the covariates for these moments to identify the parameters. In some circumstances, the corresponding GMM estimator reaches the semiparametric efficiency bound. Monte Carlo simulations suggest good finite sample performances.*
