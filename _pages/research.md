<em>We consider fixed effects binary choice models with a fixed number of periods $T$ and without a large support condition on the regressors. If the time-varying unobserved terms are i.i.d. with known distribution $F$, Chamberlain (2010) shows that the common slope parameter is point identified if and only if $F$ is logistic. However, he only considers in his proof $T=2$. We show that actually, the result does not generalize to $T\geq 3$: the common slope parameter can be identified when $F$ belongs to a family including the logit distribution. Identification is based on a conditional moment restriction. Under restrictions on the covariates, these moment conditions lead to point identification of relative effects. Finally, if $T=3$ and mild conditions hold, GMM estimators based on these conditional moment restrictions reach the semiparametric efficiency bound.
