  <details><summary>[Abstract] [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09998">Paper</a>]</summary>
<p>
<em>By exploiting McFadden (1974)'s results on conditional logit estimation, we show that there exists a one-to-one mapping between existence and uniqueness of conditional maximum likelihood estimates of the binary logit model with fixed effects and the spatial configuration of data points. Our results extend those in Albert and Anderson (1984) for the cross-sectional case and can be used to build a simple algorithm that detects spurious estimates in finite samples. Importantly, we show an instance from artificial data for which the STATA's command clogit returns spurious estimates.
