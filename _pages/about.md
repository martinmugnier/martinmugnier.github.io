Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/">Paris School of Economics (PSE)</a>. Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) and a Non-Stipendiary Research Fellow at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/).


My main field of research is Econometrics, with a focus on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models. I am particularly interested in the use of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning tools (e.g., unsupervised clustering for grouped fixed effects) to solve such problems. 

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), which I prepared at [CREST](http://crest.science/) and defended at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/) in June 2023.
