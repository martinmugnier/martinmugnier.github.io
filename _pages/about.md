Welcome!

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [CREST](http://crest.science/), [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/) in June 2023.

In September 2023, I will join the Department of Economics at <a href="https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University</a> as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. 
In September 2024, I will join the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/">Paris School of Economics (PSE)</a> as an Assistant Professor.

My main field of research is Econometrics, with a focus on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models. I am particularly interested in the use of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning tools (e.g., unsupervised clustering for grouped fixed effects) to solve such problems.
