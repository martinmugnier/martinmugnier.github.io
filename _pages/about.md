Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [CREST](http://crest.science/), [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/) under the supervision of Prof. [Xavier D'Haultfœuille](https://faculty.crest.fr/xdhaultfoeuille/) since September 2019. 

My main field of research is Econometrics, with a focus on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models. I am particularly interested in the use of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning tools (e.g., unsupervised clustering for grouped fixed effects) to solve such problems.

**I am on the 2022/2023 Academic Job Market, available for interviews.**

[CV](https://github.com/martinmugnier/martinmugnier.github.io/raw/master/files/CV_Martin_Mugnier.pdf) -- [Job Market Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KhmV8tOcoGdIMMpQ4aaw0ddvyeL5tG4V/view?usp=sharing)

I visited the Department of Economics of the University of Chicago in the Winter and Spring of 2022, invited by Prof. Stéphane Bonhomme. 

I am co-organizer of the [Statistics•Econometrics•Machine-Learning](https://statecoml.github.io/) seminar at CREST.
