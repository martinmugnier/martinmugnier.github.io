Welcome on my personal webpage !

I am a Ph.D. Student at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics (CREST) under the supervision of Professor Xavier D'Haultf≈ìuille (CREST/ENSAE) since September 2019.  
My research interests mainly lie on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models and their connections with high-dimensional statistics/machine learning. I am  broadly intested in theoretical econometrics, applications of machine learning and teaching.

I am co-organizer of the Statistics-Econometrics-Machine Learning seminar at CREST (Stat-Eco-ML), as well as the internal Firms and Market seminar.
