Welcome on my personal webpage.

I am a Ph.D. Student at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](http://crest.science/)) hosted at [ENSAE IP Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/) under the supervision of Professor [Xavier D'Haultf≈ìuille](https://faculty.crest.fr/xdhaultfoeuille/) ([[CREST](http://crest.science/)-[ENSAE IP Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/)) since September 2019. My research focuses on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models and the search for new links with high-dimensional statistics/machine learning theory.

I am co-organizer of the Statistics-Econometrics-Machine Learning seminar at CREST ([Stat-Eco-ML](https://statecoml.github.io/)), as well as the internal Firms and Market (Ph.D.) seminar.
