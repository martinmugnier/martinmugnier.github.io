Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at [CREST](http://crest.science/), [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/) under the supervision of Prof. [Xavier D'Haultfœuille](https://faculty.crest.fr/xdhaultfoeuille/) since September 2019. 

My main field of research is Econometrics, with a focus on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models. I am particularly interested in the use of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning tools (e.g., unsupervised clustering for grouped fixed effects) to solve such problems.

I visited the Department of Economics of the University of Chicago in the Winter and Spring of 2022, invited by Prof. Stéphane Bonhomme. 

I am co-organizer of the [Statistics•Econometrics•Machine-Learning](https://statecoml.github.io/) seminar at CREST.
