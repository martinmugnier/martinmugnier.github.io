Welcome on my website !

# About me
I am a Ph.D. Student at [CREST](http://crest.science/)/[ENSAE IP Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/) under the supervision of Professor [Xavier D'Haultf≈ìuille](https://faculty.crest.fr/xdhaultfoeuille/) since September 2019. 

My research focuses on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models. I am also interested with the use of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning theory to solve such problems.

I am co-organizer of the *Statistics-Econometrics-Machine Learning* seminar at CREST ([Stat-Eco-ML](https://statecoml.github.io/)), as well as the internal *Firms and Market (Ph.D.)* seminar.
