Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), with an affiliation to [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/).

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [CREST](http://crest.science/), [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/) in June 2023.

My main field of research is Econometrics, with a focus on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models. I am particularly interested in the use of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning tools (e.g., unsupervised clustering for grouped fixed effects) to solve such problems. 

In September 2024, I will join the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/">Paris School of Economics (PSE)</a> as an Assistant Professor (tenure track).
