Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at [CREST](http://crest.science/), [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/) under the supervision of Prof. [Xavier D'Haultf≈ìuille](https://faculty.crest.fr/xdhaultfoeuille/). I will join the Department of Economics at <a href="https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University</a> as a Postdoctoral Researcher in September 2023. I will join the <a href="https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/about/">Paris School of Economics (PSE)</a> as an Assistant Professor in September 2024.

My main field of research is Econometrics, with a focus on identification and estimation of nonlinear panel data models. I am particularly interested in the use of high-dimensional statistics and machine learning tools (e.g., unsupervised clustering for grouped fixed effects) to solve such problems.
